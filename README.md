# AimCrafter

AimCrafter is a website made for those who are obssessed for crafts, doodle, watercolor and everything related to art.

Everyone can see the crafts posted for other users. but in order to post yours, the user needs to first create a
account.

Every craft contains information about how the artist felt about that craft, such as how long it took to create and
level of difficulty.
